# DanicaFisk
DanicaFisk is the first esoteric programming language I made with a real interpreter.

DanicaFisk is a combination of two words, Danica and Fisk First off, Danica is the latin word for danish (According to google translate) and Fisk is the danish word for fish and I am danish so I chose DanicaFisk which again is Danish Fish.

and the name was inspired by the programming language fish or ><> and it's deriatives but not the language itself.
